## **1. Overview**

### **Project Brief**

This study aims to explore the potential factors influencing the occurrence of traffic accidents in Thailand through exploratory data analysis (EDA), revealing underlying patterns and risk distributions. Utilizing road accident data from Thailand spanning 2019 to 2022, the analysis will focus on the following aspects:

-   **Temporal Factors** Examine accident timings by year, month, and day to identify seasonal trends and peak periods, including potential impacts from holidays and special events.

-   **Accident Types and Severity**\
    Categorize accidents (e.g., collisions, rollovers, rear-end crashes) and assess severity through casualty and damage statistics; explore correlations with time and location.

-   **Other Potential Influencing Factors**\
    Investigate additional variables like weather, road conditions, and vehicle types to evaluate their effects on accident occurrences and interactions.

Overall, this EDA will use visualization tools and statistical methods to analyze traffic accidents in Thailand. The goal is to identify key factors affecting accidents and provide data-driven insights to support traffic safety improvements and policy development.

## **2. Data Preparation**

### **2.1 Install and launch R packages**

We load the following R packages using the `pacman::p_load()` function:

-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/): Core collection of R packages designed for data science

-   [**ggthemes**](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/): to use additional themes for ggplot2

-   [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/): to prepare composite figure created using ggplot2

-   [**ggridges**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html): to plot ridgeline plots

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/): for visualizations of distributions and uncertainty

-   [**scales**](https://scales.r-lib.org/): provides the internal scaling infrastructure used by ggplot2

-   [**plotly**](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/getting-started/)**:** R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs

-   [**ggstatsplot**](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/): Based Plots with Statistical Details

-   [**ggpubr**](https://github.com/kassambara/ggpubr): For publication-ready plots

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,ggthemes,
               ggridges, ggdist,
               patchwork, scales,
               corrplot, ggstatsplot, 
               plotly,ggpubr,
               performance, kableExtra,
               lubridate)
```

### **2.2 Import Data**

This project analyzes Thailand's road accident dataset, covering nationwide traffic incidents from 2019 to 2022, including their time, location, and characteristics.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv")
```

### **2.3 Overview of the data**

The dataset consists of 81,735 observations and multiple variables. Each row details a recorded road accident event in Thailand between 2019 and 2022, including the date, location, casualties, and other relevant characteristics of the incident.

#### **Use `head()` to view data**

```{r}
head(data)
```

We find that there are several columns written by Thai language, so we have to clean the data before we use it. The code below can help us.

```{r}
data <- subset(data, select = -c(province_th, route))
```

Check the data again

```{r}
head(data)
```

Next, we will check if there is any missing value in our columns.

```{r}
# check missing values
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(data)) 

missing_values_only <- missing_values[missing_values > 0]

missing_values_only %>% kable() 
```

Check the pattern of missing values: Both latitude and longitude have 359 missing values, which may indicate that these missing values occur in the same rows (e.g., some accident records completely lack location coordinates). You can verify this by checking:

```{r}
sum(is.na(data$latitude) & is.na(data$longitude))
```

Since the missing value is only 0.439%, we can remove the missing value.

```{r}
data_clean <- na.omit(data)
colSums(is.na(data_clean))
```

#### **Use `duplicate()` to check for duplicates**

There are no duplicate entries in the dataset.

```{r}
data[duplicated(data_clean),]
```

Check the type of data

```{r}
str(data_clean)
```

Change the data type

```{r}
data_clean$incident_datetime <- as.POSIXct(data_clean$incident_datetime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
data_clean$report_datetime <- as.POSIXct(data_clean$report_datetime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")


data_clean$province_en <- as.factor(data_clean$province_en)
data_clean$agency <- as.factor(data_clean$agency)
data_clean$vehicle_type <- as.factor(data_clean$vehicle_type)
data_clean$presumed_cause <- as.factor(data_clean$presumed_cause)
data_clean$accident_type <- as.factor(data_clean$accident_type)
data_clean$weather_condition <- as.factor(data_clean$weather_condition)
data_clean$road_description <- as.factor(data_clean$road_description)
data_clean$slope_description <- as.factor(data_clean$slope_description)


str(data_clean)
```
