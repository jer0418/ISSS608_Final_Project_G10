## **1. Introduction and Motivation** 

Traffic accidents represent a pressing public health and safety challenge in Thailand, resulting in substantial loss of life, injuries, and economic costs. With over 20,000 road traffic fatalities annually, Thailand ranks among the highest globally for road traffic mortality, according to the World Health Organization. This project is motivated by the urgent need to understand the underlying patterns and causes of these incidents to inform evidence-based interventions. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of traffic accidents from 2019 to 2022, this study aims to uncover actionable insights that can guide policymakers, traffic authorities, and communities in reducing accident rates and mitigating their devastating impacts.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset for this project covers traffic accidents in Thailand from 2019 to 2022, providing a detailed and multifaceted view of incidents across the country. It includes the following key attributes:

-   **Temporal Data**: Dates and times of incidents and reports (incident_datetime, report_datetime).

-   **Geographical Data**: Province names in Thai and English (province_th, province_en), along with latitude and longitude coordinates (latitude, longitude)

-   **Accident Details**: Information on vehicle types (vehicle_type), presumed causes (presumed_cause), accident types (accident_type), number of vehicles involved (number_of_vehicles_involved), fatalities (number_of_fatalities), and injuries (number_of_injuries).

-   **Environmental Factors**: Weather conditions (weather_condition), road descriptions (road_description), and slope descriptions (slope_description).

-   **Administrative Data**: Reporting agency (agency) and route details (route).

This dataset's breadth and depth make it an invaluable resource for analyzing spatial, temporal, and causal trends in traffic accidents across Thailand.

## **3. Objectives** 

The primary goals of this project are:

-   To identify trends and patterns in traffic accidents across provinces and time periods.

-   To investigate the relationships between accident severity and factors such as weather, and road conditions.

-   To develop predictive models that forecast accident likelihood or severity, enabling proactive safety measures.

-   To deliver an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore the data and insights dynamically.

## **4. Data Sources** 

The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle, which aggregates accident reports from various agencies nationwide. Spanning 2019 to 2022, this reliable and comprehensive dataset captures incidents from both urban and rural regions, ensuring a representative sample of Thailand's traffic accident landscape.

## 5. Methodology

This project will employ the following three analysis methods to investigate the dataset, with each step building upon the insights gained from the previous one.

### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   **Objective**: To investigate the dataset’s key characteristics and uncover relationships between variables.

-   **Approach**:

    -   Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, will be calculated for important variables to summarize their central tendencies and spread.

    -   Visualization tools, including histograms, box plots, or scatter plots, will be used to examine the distributions of variables and identify potential patterns or correlations in the data

-   **Expected Outcome**:

    -   A thorough overview of the dataset’s structure and significant features, providing a foundation of insights to inform the predictive modeling process.

### Step 2: Time Series Analysis (Province Focus)

-   **Objective**: To examine trends and patterns in the data over time, with a particular emphasis on differences across provinces.

-   **Approach**:

    -   The data will be organized by province and time periods (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to construct time series specific to each province.

    -   Time series analysis techniques will be applied to detect trends, seasonal variations, or other temporal patterns that may differ between provinces.

-   **Expected Outcome**:

    -   A detailed understanding of how the data changes over time within each province, highlighting key trends, seasonal effects, or unusual deviations.

### Step 3: Predictive Modeling

-   **Objective**: To develop a model that forecasts future outcomes or trends using historical data.

-   **Approach**:

    -   The dataset will be divided into training and testing sets to enable model development and validation.

    -   A machine learning algorithm will be selected and trained on the training data to predict the target variable.

    -   The model’s performance will be evaluated using suitable metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to measure its effectiveness and reliability.

-   **Expected Outcome**:

    -   A working predictive model capable of accurately forecasting the target variable, accompanied by an assessment of its performance and potential limitations

### Step 4: Interactive Dashboard Development (Shiny)

## **5. Expected Outcomes**

-   Build a **Shiny App** to allow users to explore weather and accident relationships. 
-   Include **interactive visualizations & filtering options**.

-   Identification of key weather-related risk factors affecting traffic safety in Singapore. 
-   Insights into accident prevention strategies under adverse weather conditions. 
-   A user-friendly web-based visual analytics tool for policymakers, transportation authorities, and researchers. 

## **6. Tools & Technologies** 

-   **Data Processing**: R (tidyverse, dplyr, lubridate) 
-   **Visualization**:ggplot2, plotly, leaflet 
-   **Interactive Dashboard**: Shiny, shinydashboard 
-   **Statistical Analysis**: correlation tests, ANOVA, regression models
