With over 20,000 road traffic fatalities annually, Thailand ranks among the highest globally for road traffic mortality, according to the World Health Organization. This project is motivated by the urgent need to understand the underlying patterns and causes of these incidents to inform evidence-based interventions. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of traffic accidents from 2019 to 2022, this study aims to uncover actionable insights that can guide policymakers, traffic authorities, and communities in reducing accident rates and mitigating their devastating impacts.\n\n\n\nThe dataset for this project covers traffic accidents in Thailand from 2019 to 2022, providing a detailed and multifaceted view of incidents across the country. It includes the following key attributes:\n\nTemporal Data: Dates and times of incidents and reports (incident_datetime, report_datetime).\nGeographical Data: Province names in Thai and English (province_th, province_en), along with latitude and longitude coordinates (latitude, longitude)\nAccident Details: Information on vehicle types (vehicle_type), presumed causes (presumed_cause), accident types (accident_type), number of vehicles involved (number_of_vehicles_involved), fatalities (number_of_fatalities), and injuries (number_of_injuries).\nEnvironmental Factors: Weather conditions (weather_condition), road descriptions (road_description), and slope descriptions (slope_description).\nAdministrative Data: Reporting agency (agency) and route details (route).\n\nThis dataset’s breadth and depth make it an invaluable resource for analyzing spatial, temporal, and causal trends in traffic accidents across Thailand.\n\n\n\nThe primary goals of this project are:\n\nTo identify trends and patterns in traffic accidents across provinces and time periods.\nTo investigate the relationships between accident severity and factors such as weather, and road conditions.\nTo develop predictive models that forecast accident likelihood or severity, enabling proactive safety measures.\nTo deliver an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore the data and insights dynamically.\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset is sourced from the Kaggle, which aggregates accident reports from various agencies nationwide. Spanning 2019 to 2022, this reliable and comprehensive dataset captures incidents from both urban and rural regions, ensuring a representative sample of Thailand’s traffic accident landscape.\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-road-accident-2019-2022/data\n\n\n\nThis project will employ the following three analysis methods to investigate the dataset, with each step building upon the insights gained from the previous one.\n\n\n\nObjective: To investigate the dataset’s key characteristics and uncover relationships between variables.\nApproach:\n\nDescriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, will be calculated for important variables to summarize their central tendencies and spread.\nVisualization tools, including histograms, box plots, or scatter plots, will be used to examine the distributions of variables and identify potential patterns or correlations in the data\n\nExpected Outcome:\n\nA thorough overview of the dataset’s structure and significant features, providing a foundation of insights to inform the predictive modeling process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective: To examine trends and patterns in the data over time, with a particular emphasis on differences across provinces.\nApproach:\n\nThe data will be organized by province and time periods (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to construct time series specific to each province.\nTime series analysis techniques will be applied to detect trends, seasonal variations, or other temporal patterns that may differ between provinces.\n\nExpected Outcome:\n\nA detailed understanding of how the data changes over time within each province, highlighting key trends, seasonal effects, or unusual deviations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective: To develop a model that forecasts future outcomes or trends using historical data.\nApproach:\n\nThe dataset will be divided into training and testing sets to enable model development and validation.\nA machine learning algorithm will be selected and trained on the training data to predict the target variable.\nThe model’s performance will be evaluated using suitable metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to measure its effectiveness and reliability.\n\nExpected Outcome:\n\nA working predictive model capable of accurately forecasting the target variable, accompanied by an assessment of its performance and potential limitations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild a Shiny App to allow users to explore weather and accident relationships. \nInclude interactive visualizations & filtering options. \n\n\n\nIdentification of key weather-related risk factors affecting traffic safety in Singapore. \nInsights into accident prevention strategies under adverse weather conditions. \nA user-friendly web-based visual analytics tool for policymakers, transportation authorities, and researchers. \n\n\n\n\n\nData Processing: R (tidyverse, dplyr, lubridate) \nVisualization:ggplot2, plotly, leaflet \nInteractive Dashboard: Shiny, shinydashboard \nStatistical Analysis: correlation tests, ANOVA, regression models \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek \nTask \n\n\nWeek 9 \nData cleaning \n\n\nWeek 10 \nExploratory Data Analysis （EDA） \n\n\nWeek 11 \nData Visualization and Analysis + Shiny App prototype \n\n\nWeek 12 \nFinal testing & documentation & Poster \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject GitHub Repository (Code, datasets, documentation) \nShiny App (Interactive dashboard for data exploration) \nProject Poster (Summary of findings) \nFinal Report (Methodology, results, conclusions)"

They may not be warriors or wizards, but they do have one powerful weapon: Visual Analytics.\nDING Hong-Yan – The data detective. With a sharp eye and a love for finding patterns, he can spot trends hiding in plain sight. If data had secrets, he’d be the one to expose them.\nKIM Jeounghyun – The artist of analytics. While others see boring numbers, he sees a chance to make charts look cool. If data could talk, his visuals would make it sing.\nLIU, Jeremy Junpeng – The code whisperer. He speaks fluent programming (and maybe a little too much R). If data were a puzzle, he’d be the guy solving it while everyone else is still reading the instructions.\nTogether, they are Group 10—on a mission to turn raw numbers into something people actually want to look at. Will they succeed? Probably. Will they drink too much coffee along the way? Definitely."
