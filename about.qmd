This is the website for Group 10's [Visual Analytics Project](https://isss608-ay2024-25jan.netlify.app/vaproject).

In the vast world of data, three brave souls—well, three friends—have set out on an adventure. They may not be warriors or wizards, but they do have one powerful weapon: **Visual Analytics.**

**DING Hong-Yan** – The data detective. With a sharp eye and a love for finding patterns, he can spot trends hiding in plain sight. If data had secrets, he’d be the one to expose them.

**KIM Jeounghyun** – The artist of analytics. While others see boring numbers, he sees a chance to make charts look cool. If data could talk, his visuals would make it sing.

**LIU, Jeremy Junpeng** – The code whisperer. He speaks fluent programming (and maybe a little too much R). If data were a puzzle, he'd be the guy solving it while everyone else is still reading the instructions.

Together, they are **Group 10**—on a mission to turn raw numbers into something people actually want to look at. Will they succeed? Probably. Will they drink too much coffee along the way? Definitely.
