<strong>【Verse 1】</strong>\
I still remember the first time, staring at that chart\
Lines and colors spoke, like data from the heart\
You said, “Let the numbers tell their story true”\
And the world looked clearer, all because of you

<strong>【Verse 2】</strong>\
Every meeting, you showed us patient care\
Even when we struggled, you were always there\
Sketching plots while guiding us through\
Our scattered thoughts found direction too

<strong>【Chorus】</strong>\
Thank you, Professor Kam, for lighting up our way\
In the maze of data, you helped us not to stray\
Each chart we make holds meaning deep and strong\
You taught us how to see what’s been there all along

Thank you, Professor Kam, for showing us the art\
Of telling silent stories with a thoughtful heart\
In every graph, your kindness shines within\
A gentle guide, through thick and thin

<strong>【Verse 3】</strong>\
From bar charts to heatmaps’ colored gleam\
From timelines to maps, and everything in between\
You taught not just the tools, but the “why”\
How to let the data speak, and not just pass by

<strong>【Chorus】</strong>\
Thank you, Professor Kam, for lighting up our way\
In the maze of data, you helped us not to stray\
Each chart we make holds meaning deep and strong\
You taught us how to see what’s been there all along

Thank you, Professor Kam, for showing us the art\
Of telling silent stories with a thoughtful heart\
In every graph, your kindness shines within\
A gentle guide, through thick and thin

<strong>【Bridge】</strong>\
The road ahead is long, but we’ll always keep\
The moments we shared, the lessons so deep\
You gave us not just knowledge, but belief\
A strength that carries us past doubt and grief\
(*But please don’t call me crying late at night…\
My wife might think I’ve got a secret side*)

<strong>【Final Chorus】</strong>\
Thank you, Professor Kam, for lighting up our way\
In the world of data, you helped us find our say\
Each thoughtful plot, each story we refine\
Is a trace of your heart, forever intertwined
